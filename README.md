# ESP32-Router-process-csn150


# Name of project 
ESP32 NAT Router


## Purpose 
Use the firmware provided from this project to use ESP32 as a NAT Router  
+ ESP32 can be used as WIFI Range Extender
+ Can be used to create a seperate WIFI network with different SSID from home network
+ Used for additonal WIFI for guest/IOT devices with different SSID
